 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VictoriaKlein, mother, teacher and since I've experienced an existential crisis, beginning developer.
 Iâ€™m interested in self-development and learning something new. I know it's a banal line,but smth necessary. I used php and sql in my thesis few years ago, then tried JS,was inspired,
 and finally I got a sense what is development world since I've been learning Java. After basics, syntax of language and OOP, I tested how servlets work 
 and later I' ve created custom version of day planner for my husband (I'm still in process actually). What is next? I don't know...maybe Spring...or Kotlin...
 or smth entirely new,haven't decided yet, but I'm excited)
